### statement of intent

just starting and not quite sure, but here is the direction

# Debugger

I don't want to use gdb anymore, and it would be easier without using the qemu setup, so:

- single step debugging of the register machine level (as close to arm as need be)
- visual transitions for steps
- visualisation of data in registers (some kind of link to the object)
- show the current instruction and a few around
- show vm object (message etc)
- show effect of register transitions on vm objects
- visualize vm object content (again some links)


# Space

- Visualise the object space in some way
- Visualise single object, bit like atoms
- values immediate
- objects as link
